###### Range
- difference between highest and lowest value
###### Variance and standard deviation
- unlike range use all values
- Quantify how much, on average, values vary of arithmetic means
- We can ignore the sign
	1. Absolute values
	2. Square differences
- Variance uses the 2. approach because it's more natural way to calculate distance
- Population variance  - when population is known
- Sample variance - when population is unknown
