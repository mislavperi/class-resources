# Graphical and tabular representation of data
Part of learning outcome 1, topic 1
- Variable satisfaction in Employee dataset
- Counting the frequencies for that dataset
- **Frequency** vs **relative frequency**
- Summarized results in **frequency table**
- Sum of relative frequencies should be 1
- Samples are usually analized
- Pie charts **should** be avoided unless one category is dominated or there aren't many categories
- In the *Salary* example which can be a range of values (continous), we should transform the data so it gets turned into categorical data, we can it **binning** the data
##### Rules of binning
- Groups should be mutually exclusive (one value can't be counted in two ranges)
- Has to cover the entire range
- We can have too many or too few bins

For:
- discrete variables we can use frequency bar charts
- continuous variables we never use frequency bar charts, we rather bin it

###### Frequency polygon
No. of people in a household | Frequency | Cum. frequency | Cum. Relative frequency
----------------------------------|-------- | ---- | ----
0 | 17 | 17 | 17%
1 | 48 | 65|65%
2 | 27 | 92 | 92%
3 | 6 | 98 | 98%
4 | 2 | 100 | 100%
5 | 0 | 100 | 100%

- Used for discrete numberic values and (sometimes) for ordinal values 
- Cumulative is used for numeric values (with continuous) and (sometimes) for ordianl values
###### Empirical cumulative distrubution
- $|{i:xi<=x}|$
- $F(x)$
- Empirical cumulative distribution is step-function
