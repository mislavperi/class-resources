Machine learning is a set of approaches for estimating *function (model)* from the data
Simulation vs Machine Leaning -> Machine Learning contains an input, output and a model that we don't know and we need to estimate it, while in the case of simulation we know the model and we use the model to generate the output from the input
We want to estimate the function because of prediction and inference

###### Prediction
In the case of prediction we can easily measure input, etc. predicting stock prices
We estimate the function that will produce the output *Y*
The function can be a black box
Accurate prediction would be the one that is close to the real value

###### Inference
In the case of inference, we want to understand the relationship between the input and output
Model is not a black box, we want to know the exact form
Goal is analysis, we don't really use prediction, not the ultimate goal
Answering questions by analysing data

###### How do we estimate the function?
We use training set
We estimate output for any data point

###### Parametric methods
Two set approach
1. We make an assumption of functional form *f*$$f(x) = Î²$$
2. After we select the model, we fit it to the data, in other words, train the model
###### Non-parametric methods
Advantage: have the potential to accurately fit a wide range of possible forms of f
Disadvantage: more parameters ?

Overfitting - when a model too closely follows the training data points
Obtained fit will not yield accurate estimates of output variables on new data points that aren't part of the original training set

###### Supervised vs. unsupervised learning methods
Supervised learning - Each data point has values for input and output variables
Goal is to fit the model that will the relate output to inputs for purpose of prediction or inference
Unsupervised learning - No output variables
We can seek to understand the relationships between variables and data points
Typical method is clustering or cluster analysis
###### Regression vs. classification problems
Variables -> Quantitative or Qualitative
Regression problem - output variable is quantitative
Classification problem - output variable is qualitative
Exceptions - logistic regression is used when we have qualitative output variable
