- Programs, created by people, guide processes
### 1.1 Elements of programming
- Three mechanisms for combining simple ideas to complex ideas
	- primitive expressions - simple entities which the language is concerned with
	- means of combination - by which we build compound elements
	- means of abstraction - by which we name and manipulate compound elements as units
- We deal with procedures and data
- Data is "stuff" and procedures are descriptions of rules for manipulating the data
#### 1.1.1 Expressions
- Numbers are primitive expressions, `486` outputs the number `486`
#### 1.1.2 Naming and the Environment
- `define` is used to define variables `define size 2` <- ties the value 2 to size
- `Define` is the simplest means of abstraction, it allows us to use simple names to refer to the results of compound operations
- Complex programs are constructed step by step, from the simplest components
- *Environment* keeps track of name object pairs
#### 1.1.3 Evaluating Combinations
- Evaluating a combination includes the following
	 - Evaluate the subexpressions
	 - Apply the procedure that is the value of the leftmost subexpression to the arguments that are the values of other subexpression
- Evaluation is recursive in nature
- Evaluating `(* (+ 2 (* 4 6)) (+ 3 5 7))` requires us applying the evaluation rule in four different combinations
- We can represent the above example as a tree, with each operation being a node
- The process of percolate values upward is known as *tree accumulation*

#### 1.1.4 Compound Procedures
- Example of a compound procedures is squaring a number `(define (square x) (* x x))`
- They hold complex operations under a simple name
#### 1.1.5 The Substitution Model for Procedure Applications
- *Substitution* model for procedure application - determines the meaning of a procedure application
- It's purpose is to help us think about procedure applications, not to describe how the interpreter works. 
- Only one of may models - a way to get started thinking formally about evaluation process
- Greater detail make the models inadequate, requiring ever more refined models
- Alternative evaluation model would first substitute the operand expressions until it obtained an expression involving only primitive operators and then preform the evaluation
- First we preform the expansions
```
(f 5) -> (sum-of-squares (+5 1) (* 5 2)) -> (+ (square (+ 5 1)) (square (* 5 2))) ->
(+ (* (+ 5 1) (+ 5 1)(* (*5 2) (*5 2 ))))
```
- Once we've broken down to the primitive operators, we preform the reduction
  ```
  (+ (* 6 6) (* 10 10)) -> (+36 100) -> 136
  ```
- This approach, fully expand and reduce,  is known as *normal-order evaluation* unlike the *applicative-order evaluation*, which evaluates the arguments and then applies them
#### 1.1.8 Procedures as Black-Box Abstractions
- Procedure definitions should be able to suppress the details
- A user should not know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it
- Procedures should be independent of the parameter names used by the authors
### 1.2 Procedures and the Processes They Generate
- Procedure is a pattern for the *local evolution* of computational process
#### 1.2.1 Linear Recursion and Iteration
