- Process of converting sets of data values from source format to format consistent for processing
- Mapping source data elements
- Ensures data enters usable and manageable
- Combines original raw attributes using either mathematical formulas originated in business or pure formulas
- Mapping can be complicated and requires a lot of rules
- Large volumes are relegated to advanced data scientists and engineers
- GUI with libraries that automate the process with libraries (Example, loading a CSV table)

- Structure may vary between applications so some mapping might be required
### Data normalization
- Process that includes a lot of mathematics
- Sometimes, we have raw attributes that have meaning in original business domain
- Not good enough to obtain accurate models
- Common to preform series of manipulation steps to transform or *normalize* the data
###### Min - max
- Min-max normalization to scale numerical variables *v* of numerical attribute *A* to specific range denoted as *[new_minA, new_maxA]*
-

###### Z-score
- When min or max values of attributes *A* are not known, it's infeasible
- Presence of outliers limits the digital precision
- If *μ* is mean of values of attribute *A* and *σ* is standard deviation, original value *v* of *A* is normalized to *v'* using
- inser the formula here!
###### Decimal scaling 
- Simple way to reduce the absolute values is by shifting the decimal point using the power of 10 division so that maximum absolute value is always below 1 after transformation
### Data distribution
###### Normal distribution
- Used in statistics to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known
- Bulk in middle, smaller percent vary from the mean
- Empirical rule states that for a normal distribution
	- 68% fall within first standard deviation from mean
	- 95% fall within two standard deviation
	- 99.7% fall between three standard deviation
###### Non normal distribution
- Many processes follow a non normal distribution
- Can occur due to naturally following a specific type of non normal distribution
- Reasons:
	- Outliers
	- Multiple distributions combined with data
	- Insufficient data
	- Data inappropriately graphed
###### Linear transformation
- Simple algebraic transformation
### Non-linear transformation
###### Box-Cox transformation
- Procedure to identify an appropriate exponent to use to transform data into a normal shape
- Way to transform non-normal dependant variables into normal shape
- Aims to transform a continuous variable into almost normal distribution
- This is achieved following sets of transformation
- FORMULA HERE
- Lambda indicates the power to which data should be raised
- Not a guarantee for normality
- Check the data using a probability plot
- Requires input data to be positive
- If you have a negative value we must add a parameter *c* to offset negative values
- FORMULA HERE LOL
- Parameter *g* used to scale resulting values, considered as the geometric mean of the data
- Value of *λ* found testing different values in range from -3.0 to 3.0 in small steps until resulting attribute is close as possible to normal distribution
- Histogram is accurate representation of numerical data
- Used when we just want to spread distribution, not convert to a normal one
- Two cases:
	- Using the logarithm can be used to spread the right side: FORMULA
	- Using the power transformation
- Higher value *g* may spread the histogram but they cause problems with digital precision 
###### Quadratic transformation
- FORMULA HERE LMAO
- Decreases values < 1
- Increases values > 1
- Large values increased the most
- Stretches the values
###### Logarithm transformation
- FORMUKA HERE LUL
- Reduces all values
- Values 0 < x < 1 become negative
- Large values reduces much more
- Compresses values
- Only applies to values > 0
###### Reciprocal transformation
- $1/x$
- Reduces all values > 1
- Larger values reduced more
- Compresses values more than log
###### Nominal to binary transformations
- Nominal variables:
	- Can't be quantified
	- Can't preform arithmetic operations on them
	- Can't be assigned order
- Map each nominal attribute to set of newly generated attributes to avoid issues
- For each instance, only one of *N* of newly created attributes will have the value of 1, rest have value of 0
